# ObjectBuffer: object-like API, backed by a [shared]arraybuffer

For Modern browsers and node.

Save, read and update plain javascript objects into `ArrayBuffer`, using regular javascript object api,
without intermediate serialization/deserialization.  

No pre-defined schema is required.
In other words, It's a user-land implementation of javascript objects, using a single ArrayBuffer as the heap.

That's enables us to `transfer` or share objects  with a `WebWorker` or other, same-origin, browsing contexts without data duplication or  full serialization.

## 游낼游낼游낼 Adventurers Beware 游낼游낼游낼
Using this library, and workers in general, will not necessarily make you code runs faster.  
First be sure where your bottlenecks are, and if you don't have a better and more simple workaround.  
I personally also really like what's going on around the [main thread scheduling proposal](https://github.com/WICG/main-thread-scheduling) and [react userland scheduler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scheduler) that powers concurrent react

## Quick example

```js
import { createObjectBuffer, getUnderlyingArrayBuffer } from "@bnaya/objectbuffer";

const initialValue = {
  foo: { bar: new Date(), arr: [1], nesting:{ WorksTM: true } }
};
// ArrayBuffer is created under the hood
const myObject = createObjectBuffer(
  {},
  // size in bytes
  1024,
  initialValue
);

const arrayBuffer = getUnderlyingArrayBuffer(myObject);

myObject.additionalProp = "new Value";
myObject.arr.push(2);

```

## API reference

[link](docs/generated/README.md)

## Why

Exchanging plain objects with `WebWorkers` is done by serializing and copying the data to the other side.  
for some use-cases, it's slow and memory expensive.  
`ArrayBuffer` can be `transferred` without a copy, and `SharedArrayBuffer` can be directly shared, but out of the box, it's hard to use `ArrayBuffer` as more than a [TypedArray](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays).  
## Disclaimer / Motivation

I'm working on it mostly from personal interest, It's not in use in any production use-case.  
Before putting any eggs in the basket, please go over the [implementation details document](docs/implementationDetails.md)

## What's working

* strings
* number
* objects (with nesting and all)
* arrays
* Date
* BigInt
* Internal references (`foo.bar2 = foo.bar` will not create a copy, but a reference)
* Automatic reference counting, to dispose a value you need to use the `disposeWrapperObject` or to have WeakRef support
* Internal equality between objects (`foo.bar === foo.bar` will be true)
* global lock for shared memory using [Atomics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Atomics) (I hope its really working)

## Caveats & Limitations

* Need to specify size for the `ArrayBuffer`. When exceed that size, exception will be thrown. (Can be extended later with a utility function, but not automatically)
* Size must be multiplication of 8
* Set, Map, Object keys can be only string or numbers. no symbols or other things
* No prototype chain. no methods on the objects
* Adding getters, setters, will not work/break the library
* deleting/removing the current key of Map/Set while iteration will make you skip the next key [#60](https://github.com/Bnaya/objectbuffer/issues/60)

### What's not working yet, but can be

* `bigint` bigger than 64 bit

### What's probably never going to work

* Anything that cannot go into `JSON.stringify`
* `Symbol`

* [FlatBuffers](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_use_javascript.html)
* And there must be more of these, look them up
